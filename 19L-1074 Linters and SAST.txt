Linters and SAST are two types of tools commonly used in software development to ensure code quality and security.

A linter is a tool that analyzes source code to detect and flag potential issues such as syntax errors, formatting inconsistencies, 
and other violations of best practices. Linters are often used to enforce a consistent coding style across a team or to catch simple 
errors before they become more serious issues.

On the other hand, SAST is a security testing tool that scans source code or compiled binaries for potential security vulnerabilities. 
SAST analyzes the code at rest, rather than during runtime, and can detect issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Both linters and SAST are automated tools that can help to identify issues early in the software development lifecycle, 
improving code quality and reducing the likelihood of bugs or security vulnerabilities being introduced later in the development process.

While linters focus on code quality and readability, SAST focuses on security. Linters can help to ensure that code is consistent and maintainable, 
while SAST can help to ensure that code is secure and free of vulnerabilities.

In summary, linters and SAST are complementary tools that can help to improve the quality and security of code. 
Linters focus on ensuring that code is readable and maintainable, while SAST focuses on ensuring that code is secure and free of vulnerabilities.
